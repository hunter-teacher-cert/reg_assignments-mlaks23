# Describing the Nature and Number of Roots of a Quadratic Function using Python

In this lesson, students write a program that identifies the nature and number of roots of a quadratic function using python. They write the code to find the discriminant and then use conditional statements to identify the nature and number of roots. Students learned how to program the quadratic formula in a previous lesson. The starter code for this lesson includes the prompts for the different parts of the process. This lesson is for an algebra 2 class and provides students with an introduction to conditionals.

Below is the link to the starter code.

I did a google search for "writing a python program to find the discriminant of quadratic equation" and these three websites came up:
- https://www.javatpoint.com/python-quadratic-equation
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-to-solve-quadratic-equation/
- https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/math/python-math-exercise-9.php

The same websites came up for the google search "python discriminant program."

It was pretty easy to find and the websites provide similar information to the way I teach the lesson. However, many of my students aren't great at googling and I'm not sure they will find websites that show the nature and number of roots and not just the quadratic formula. These websites do have code that is copyable, but the lesson is meant to do as a code along with beginner students, so they can follow what I type. I think this activity is simple enough for more advanced students that they wouldn't need to copy the code from an internet search.
