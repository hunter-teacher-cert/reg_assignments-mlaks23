# The CS-Ed Podcast: Season 2 Episode 4: Grading for Equity
## Kristin Stephens-Martinez and Joe Feldman
### How do we grade for equity?

#### Do you agree with the general sentiment or not?
In theory, I  agree with Mr. Feldman's sentiments. Students should be participating in class and completing their homework for the purposes of learning and not only for the purpose of a grade. In practice, it's much more difficult to implement.

#### Do you have specific points of agreement/disagreement?
I do agree that we frequently do what has always been done. However, in the case of a grading policy for math classes, the way I was graded was different than how I grade my students. In fact, it seems that the way I was graded was more like the grading for equity described by Mr. Feldman. My whole grade in high school math classes was based on assessments. Homework was not part of my grade, but the expectation was that I  completed my homework every night. There was also no participation credit. We were just expected to participate. We understood that by participating and completing homework, we could understand the content better. My students don't seem to understand that. They often feel that homework is assigned for no reason. They care more about points than they do about learning. It often feels that the only way they will do something is if it is going to affect their grade.


#### Do you think that you would be able to implement some of these ideas in your class? If not, what would keep you from doing so?

My school has a uniform grading policy which does not allow for much flexibility in grading. In the math department, Assessment is worth 60%, homework is worth 15% and class participation is worth 25%. Anytime we want to change the policy, it has to go through the school leadership team and can take several months.  They encourage us to grade for equity, but the policy does not support this.

I would like to know more specific ways to get my students to internalize the importance of paying attention in class, productive struggle and practicing in learning and not just doing work for the sake of their grade.
