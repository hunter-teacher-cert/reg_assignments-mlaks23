# Grading for rank_choice_lab.py

### Assignment
Students are given 9 problems that involve writing parts of a program that represents the results of ranked choice voting on the leader of the Avengers.

The problems are listed below:

- Problem 0: Function that takes in csv data and returns a list of lists. (2 points)
- Problem 1: Function that takes in a list of list and returns a dictionary showing the number of - votes for a candidate in a rank. (2 points)
- Problem 2: Function that creates a bar graph of voting data.  (2 points)
- Problem 3: Function that creates a pie chart for the percentages of votes per candidates. (2 points)
- Problem 4: Function that takes in a dictionary and calculates percentages of the total vote. (2 points)
- Problem 5: Function that takes in a dictionary and returns the percent vote of the top candidate. (2 points)
- Problem 6: Function that creates a new list without the last place candidate. (2 points)
- Problem 7: Recalculate based on problem_6. Display charts and calculate percentages. (3 points)
- Problem 8: Reset data and automate ranked choice voting. (3 points)

### Grading
I would make the whole assignment count as 20 points with point values listed above.  Each problem would be graded holistically. If the function works in the intended way, the student would get full points. If there are small errors, students would lose a point. If there the problem was blank or completely wrong, the student would not get credit for that part.

### Rationale
Most problems seem to be independent of each other, so I would grade each problem separately. In an assignment that builds on previous parts, I would grade holistically rather than by part.
