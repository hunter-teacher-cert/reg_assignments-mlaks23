## "Russia is Facing a Tech Worker Exodus"

Since the start of the Ukraine war 50,000 to 70,000 tech workers have fled Russia with 70,000 to 100,000 more to leave in April. They have fled to countries where Russian citizen can travel to without a visa, such as Turkey, Armenia, and Georgia. Some of the workers have left because they oppose the war and others have left due to the threat of sanctions. According to the article, "Because of their interconnectedness with the global digital economy, [Russian tech workers] were quick to feel the pain from sanctions and the departure of Western technology companies, and they have an easier time making a living from their laptops regardless of location." A London-based firm is helping anti-war technology workers from Russia, Belarus and Ukraine find jobs. Since many companies have stopped doing business in Russia, it is harder for software engineers, data scientists, and other tech workers to do their jobs.

I think this is an effect of the war in Ukraine that is relevant to computer science and that students may not discuss in other classes. It shows how people in Russia are also affected by the actions of Putin.
