# SEDC 72900 Computer Science Teaching Methods II: Final Project
## Voter Turnout Data Science Lesson
### Marisa Laks

#### Common Thread: Lesson Aligned to the New York State CS Standards
- 9-12.CT.2 Collect and evaluate data from multiple sources for use in a computational artifact.
- 9-12.CT.3 Refine and visualize complex data sets to tell different stories with the same data set.

#### Rationale:
In this lesson, students will perform methods on tables and write functions to analyze data from a dataset of Voter Turnout by State from 2020 in order to investigate Voter Suppression. The dataset comes from the US Census Bureau. It contains data about the population of people living in the US over the age of 18. The programs students write in this lesson use the language Pyret.

#### Aim:
How do we write and use table methods and functions in order to analyze data about Voter Turnout?

#### SWBAT:
Define variables, apply table methods, write functions and display data in charts.

#### Differntiation:
This code is scaffolded to give all students entry points where they are at. Students who need more help have access to the pyret codes. Students with stronger skills will be able to go at their own pace and perform higher level analysis.

#### Changes Based on Feedback:
We first had to decide what we should use as a common thread for a lesson. That was a bit difficult because we all teach different things. We decided our common theme should be writing lessons aligned to the new New York State CS Standards. This lesson is aligned to the two Computational Thinking standards under the Data Analysis and Visualization subconcept. My team helped me think about the data set I wanted to use and how I could manipulate the dataset to meet the needs for my students.
