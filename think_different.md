I currently teach an ICT Data Science class. In the class, there are several students with learning disabilities and a few English language learners. Very few students had any coding experience prior to taking this class. There are also many students that are frequently absent (more than 2 times a week). For all of the tasks, students can work in pairs to help each other, however each student should submit their own code.

## Strategy 1
### Scaffolded Code
For students who need extra help knowing what to do, we provide them with scaffolded code and questions written as comments. The code also shows examples that students can follow so they can get started on their own with little guidance from the teachers.


## Strategy 2
### Choices
Students can be given options for tasks to complete. Students can choose a task based on their ability/prior knowledge or interest. This is helpful for students who are frequently absent because they may have missed certain instruction, but will still be able to complete the assignment.

## Strategy 3
### Open Ended Tasks
Unlike the scaffolded code, this one provides little instruction to what students need to complete. They can demonstrate any knowledge they have learned throughout a specific unit. This type of task works best with a rubric that students can follow so they know what to include.
