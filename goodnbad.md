# Good and Bad

*Describe an instance when you were teaching something computer science related and it went poorly.*  

-I am teaching data science with the Bootstrap curriculum (https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/latest/en-us/courses/data-science/) using the Pyret coding language (https://code.pyret.org/). In the CS4All training we do, the facilitator stressed we should have the students write examples on paper and in their code before writing functions. I didn't (and still don't) really understand why students should write these example and struggled with how to write them. I am able to write the functions without the examples and prefer to do so. When I first taught the students to write the functions using the examples, I wrote the examples and they didn't quite work the way they were supposed to.

*Why do you think it didn't go well?*

-I think it didn't go well because I didn't fully understand the way to write the examples and wasn't fully invested in the importance of the examples.

*What would you do (have you done) to make it better?*

-It would have been better if I got more help from the other teachers at my school or from the forum on the website before trying to explain to the students.

*Describe an instance when you were teaching something computer science related and it went really well.*

-Over the summer I taught a week of p5.js for Upperline Code. The students worked on projects together using pair programming. They came up with some great projects.

*Why do you think it went so well?*

-I think the students wanted to be in the class. They were willing to take risks and make mistakes. They were present and engaged throughout the whole week.
