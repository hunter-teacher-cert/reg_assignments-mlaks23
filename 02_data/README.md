# Data Science Lesson #

Students will investigate a dataset about different jobs and the education they require. The dataset includes the percentage of non-white and female employees. It also includes the annual median wage, weekly median wage and female weekly median wage. The activities involve writing functions and sorting data to find out which jobs pay the most, which jobs pay more for females, etc. Then students will create data displays based on smaller groups from the dataset. 

This lesson includes the lesson plan, presentation, dataset, code as a pyret file and as a text file and a pdf of the solution.
